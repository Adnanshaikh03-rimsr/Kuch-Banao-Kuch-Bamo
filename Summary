# Creativity-Design-Thinking
The presentation "KUCH BANAO : KUCH BANO 2024" focuses on design thinking to empower young athletes, particularly in basketball and swimming. The project, titled "Play Forward: Empowering the Next Generation of Athletes," aims to address the challenges faced by athletes due to inadequate facilities, lack of professional guidance, and limited competitive opportunities in both urban and rural areas. Research methods such as empathy mapping, surveys, and internet research were used to identify key pain points, including limited infrastructure, lack of events, and insufficient coaching support. Insights from this research led to the development of a solutionâ€”a sports-focused application that provides a community platform, professional training resources, event organization, and mentorship opportunities. The final prototype integrates user-friendly features such as profile creation, community discussions, push notifications, analytics, and event tracking to foster talent development and create an inclusive sports ecosystem.
